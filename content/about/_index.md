My name is Germán, I was born in Argentina. I studied a master's degree in Computer Engineering at the Universidad Nacional del Litoral, in Santa Fe, Argentina. I am the oldest of six siblings... Yes, there are a lot of us in my family haha. I also like soccer very much, I'm a Colón de Santa Fe fan. I got married in 2022, her name is Agustina and we like to listen to music and travel.
